# Transaction Sorter

## About

This is the app for the Transaction Sorter project.

It was built to handle sorting split transactions from YNAB by category that didn't sort according to the split value of the category. For example, if a transaction was $20 total, with $15 Groceries, and $5 Dining Out, when sorting Grocery transactions, YNAB would sort by the $20 value instead of the $15 Grocery portion.
